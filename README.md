This is very much __Work In Progress__

For users of Vert.x in Java.

Helps you to write complex, yet legible, asynchronous logic with elegance, efficiency and flair.

Inspired by Promises/A+ specification.

## Goals:

* Typesafe
* Efficient for developers and computers
* Ability to create arbitrary compute graphs of futures i.e. ...
* Join multiple futures together in a type safe manner (using first-class tuples)
* Proper *Destructuring* of collection of futues to a lambda equivalent number of parameters

## Examples

To follow.
